Description: Methods to compute linear h-step ahead prediction coefficients based
    on localised and iterated Yule-Walker estimates and empirical mean squared
    prediction errors for the resulting predictors. Also, functions to compute
    autocovariances for AR(p) processes, to simulate tvARMA(p,q) time series,
    and to verify an assumption from a paper by the authors.
